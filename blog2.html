            <img src="main.jpeg" alt="main" class="left">
            <p>The biggest challenge in student's life is to choose their appropriate stream after std 10th. After 10th results are out, there is one common question that strikes
                in every student’s mind “What next after 10th”? Science, Commerce or Arts? Especially those who are not sure about their future,selecting proper stream becomes very
                difficult.Every field has a lot of career opportunities but choosing the right stream which students are interested should be the main concern. This one decision often
                turns out to be one of the most important pronouncements of life.A right decision can help you blossom in your career. And if you make the wrong choice, you will have 
                to face the consequences for the rest of your life. <br><br>
                 
                So how to deal with this problem?
                
                How to select proper stream for your career?
                
                Do you know all the information about the stream you are going to study?<br><br>
                
                Many many such questions must arise in the mind of students as well as parents when selecting stream. Any mistake in selection of stream can cost your career.Career
                counselling and career guidance for 10th class is the need of the hour. Career counselling with a trained career counsellor can help you solve your confusion.
                It has been often noticed student start hating their subject after some time or quit their subject midway or start feeling frustrated about the wrong move or decision.
                To avoid this, you must require proper career guidance. <br><br>
                
                <span class="bold">Mistakes we often do while selecting our career:</span> <br><br>

                <img src="1st.jpg" alt="1st" class="right">
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Selecing any stream without even knowing about it. Many students who are unaware about their future select any stream and then later starts hating it. This happens because lack of knowledge about their particular 
                        stream. Before selecing any stream, we must understand it in core in order to know about it. There are many career options available and with the help of proper 
                        career guidance and career counselling, you can see the light at the end of the tunnel.</li><br>
                    <li>Parental pressure/any other external pressure. <br>
                        Let’s look at a common scenario. <br><br>
                    
                        You: Dad, I want to take up Arts stream. <br>
                        Dad: There is no future in the Arts stream. You have to take up science. Look at Sharmaji's son. He had taken up science stream and he is doing very well in life.
                             There is no much scope in any other stream. <br><br>
                    
                        I am sure many students would have faced this situation. I am sure, that many parents would have given the examples of some Sharma or Gupta to influence the 
                        decision of their child. This can lead to a flawed career decision. Remember it's your decision and it's your career. No one is going to affect except you. 
                        So take your career decision wisely.</li>

                <span class="bold">Different streams available after std 10th.</span>

                    <li><span class="bold">Science: </span><br><br>
                        <img src="science.jpg" alt="science" class="left">
                        Most widely taken stream and popular in the minds of parents and some students. There are various myths in the minds of people who are selecting their career in
                        science stream. Science stream offers many lucrative career options such as engineering, medical, IT and you can even opt for research roles. The most famous are 
                        Medical and Engineering. IIT, AIMS, MBBS are major things targeted in science stream. <br><br>

                        optional. <br> <br>
                     
                        Science doesnot only ends with 12th but has different entrance exams according to your subjects you have taken. For engineering some famous exams are JEE, CET, etc.
                        while for medical its NEET. <br><br>
                     
                        Another major advantage is that it allows students to change streams and take up Arts or Commerce later in their lives if they are not at ease with programs or 
                        specializations available at the graduation level. <br><br></li>
