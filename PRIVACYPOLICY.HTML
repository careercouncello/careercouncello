          <p>
            It is CareerCouncello's policy to respect your privacy regarding any
            information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy
            Policy applies to
            <a href="https://CareerCouncello.com"
              >https://CareerCouncello.com</a
            >
            (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "https://CareerCouncello.com"). We
            respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally
            identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We
            have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what
            information may be collected on our Website, how we use this
            information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the
            information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to
            information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our
            collection of information from other sources.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted
            on our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing
            your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting
            our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and
            conditions.
          </p>

          <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
          <p>
            Like most website operators, CareerCouncello collects
            non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
            and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,
            language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
            visitor request. CareerCouncello's purpose in collecting
            non-personally identifying information is to better understand how
            CareerCouncello's visitors use its website. From time to time,
            CareerCouncello may release non-personally-identifying information
            in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the
            usage of its website.
          </p>
          <p>
            CareerCouncello also collects potentially personally-identifying
            information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in
            users and for users leaving comments on https://CareerCouncello.com
            blog posts. CareerCouncello only discloses logged in user and
            commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and
            discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
          </p>

          <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
          <p>
            Certain visitors to CareerCouncello's websites choose to interact
            with CareerCouncello in ways that require CareerCouncello to gather
            personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
            information that CareerCouncello gathers depends on the nature of
            the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog
            at https://CareerCouncello.com to provide a username and email
            address.
          </p>

          <h2>Security</h2>
          <p>
            The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but
            remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method
            of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use
            commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information,
            we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
          </p>

          <h2>Advertisements</h2>
          <p>
            Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by
            advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the
            ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an
            online advertisement to compile information about you or others who
            use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among
            other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will
            be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of
            cookies by CareerCouncello and does not cover the use of cookies by
            any advertisers.
          </p>
